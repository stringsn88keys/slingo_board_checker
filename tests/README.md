## Test Framework

The test suite uses a custom lightweight testing framework (`SimpleTest.php`) that provides:

- Assertion methods (assertTrue, assertEquals, assertArrayHasKey, etc.)
- Test result tracking
- Detailed error reporting
- Success/failure statistics

## Continuous Integration

Tests can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Run all tests and exit with proper status code
php tests/simple_test_runner.php
echo $?  # 0 for success, 1 for failure
```

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Create a new test class extending `SimpleTest`
2. Implement test methods starting with `test`
3. Use assertion methods to validate behavior
4. Add the test class to `simple_test_runner.php`

Example:
```php
class MyNewTest extends SimpleTest {
    public function testMyFeature() {
        // Test implementation
        $this->assertTrue($condition, 'Error message');
    }
}
```

## Test Data

Test data is generated dynamically to ensure:
- Realistic board configurations
- Edge case coverage
- Random number validation
- Boundary condition testing

## Performance Benchmarks

Current performance metrics:
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms average
- **Memory Usage**: < 10MB per request
- **Concurrent Requests**: 5+ simultaneous requests
- **Test Execution Time**: < 5 seconds for full suite

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Class not found errors**: Ensure all require_once paths are correct
2. **Server not running**: Start PHP development server for integration tests
3. **Permission errors**: Check file permissions for test execution

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output by setting:
```php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
```

## Future Enhancements

- Automated test coverage reporting
- Visual test result dashboard
- Performance regression testing
- Automated mobile device testing
- Load testing with realistic user scenarios
