## Test Framework

The test suite uses a custom lightweight testing framework (`SimpleTest.php`) that provides:

- Assertion methods (assertTrue, assertEquals, assertArrayHasKey, etc.)
- Test result tracking
- Detailed error reporting
- Success/failure statistics

## Continuous Integration

Tests can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Run all tests and exit with proper status code
php tests/simple_test_runner.php
echo $?  # 0 for success, 1 for failure
```

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Create a new test class extending `SimpleTest`
### ✅ Memory Optimization Testing
- Tile placement heuristic for 5+ super wilds
- Memory efficiency validation (< 2 seconds execution)
- Priority-based tile placement (center → corners → diagonal → others)
- Multiple draw row wild placement handling
- Scalability testing with large wild card counts

### ✅ Algorithm Enhancement Testing
- Priority system validation (3-tier hierarchy)
- Depth-first search algorithm coverage
- Completed Slingo detection (Priority 1, score >10000)
- Diagonal priority handling (Priority 2)
- Setup move optimization (Priority 3)
- Edge case handling and validation

2. Implement test methods starting with `test`
3. Use assertion methods to validate behavior
4. Add the test class to `simple_test_runner.php`

Example:
```php
class MyNewTest extends SimpleTest {
    public function testMyFeature() {
        // Test implementation
        $this->assertTrue($condition, 'Error message');
    }
}
```

## Additional Algorithm Testing Rules

When implementing new algorithm logic, always add tests for:

1. **Core Functionality**: Basic operation validation
2. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error handling
3. **Performance**: Memory usage and execution time
4. **Integration**: How the feature works with existing code
5. **Priority Systems**: Scoring and ranking validation
6. **Memory Optimization**: Heuristic fallback mechanisms

## Test Data

Test data is generated dynamically to ensure:
- Realistic board configurations
- Edge case coverage
- Random number validation
- Boundary condition testing

## Performance Benchmarks

Current performance metrics:
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms average
- **Memory Usage**: < 10MB per request
- **Concurrent Requests**: 5+ simultaneous requests
- **Test Execution Time**: < 5 seconds for full suite

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Class not found errors**: Ensure all require_once paths are correct
2. **Server not running**: Start PHP development server for integration tests
3. **Permission errors**: Check file permissions for test execution

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output by setting:
```php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
```

## Future Enhancements

- Automated test coverage reporting
- Visual test result dashboard
- Performance regression testing
- Automated mobile device testing
- Load testing with realistic user scenarios
